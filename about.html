            <h2 class="text-center">Mission</h2>
            <p>The primary mission of <strong>Pathway to Light</strong> is to reach out to young people with Biblical
              truth in the hope of pointing them to the Light
              who is Jesus Christ. <br>We endeavor to influence the young people with the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
              Christ.<br> The chief aim is that through the presentation
              of the Gospel as a sufficient tool for all of life, that their choices in life are not influenced by the
              evil that surrounds them but with the truth
              of the gospel.<br> Therefore, our prayer is that the young people are equipped with God’s word, and by
              God’s grace <strong>Pathway to Light</strong> will do
              it with complete patience and the sound teaching of doctrine.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Vision</h2>
            <p>Our vision is to raise a generation of young people that are acquainted with Scripture, which makes one
              wise for salvation through faith in
              Jesus Christ as scripture expresses in 2 Timothy 3:15. <br> We aim at building a team that reaches out to
              the young people through evangelism, training,
              and discussions all for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Statement of Faith</h2>
            <p> The statements below speak the heart of our convictions as it concerns our faith:</p>

            <h2 class="text-center"> The Holy Scriptures</h2>
            <p>We believe and teach that the Holy Scriptures which constitute the entire sixty-six books of the Bible
              are sufficient, infallible, and inerrant as the <br>
              original manuscripts were inspired equally in all parts by the Holy Spirit. We believe that the Bible is
              divinely revealed and is the authoritative word of
              God to which we are all called to faithfully submit.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center"> The Trinity and God the Father</h2>
            <p>We believe and teach that there is only one living and true God whose being is spirit. We affirm that He
              is eternal, infinite, all-knowing, unchangeable<br>
              in His being, and is perfect in all His attributes.<br> We also believe that He exists eternally in three
              distinct yet fully divine persons; the Father,
              the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br> The three persons are the same in substance, true, and eternally God in
              oneness, all equally deserving of worship and
              obedience as they are equal in power and glory.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center"> Jesus Christ (God the Son)</h2>
            <p>We believe and teach that Jesus Christ who is the second person of the Trinity, is truly God and truly
              man in indivisible oneness.<br> We teach that in the incarnation, Jesus accepted humanness becoming the
              God-man having been born of the Virgin Mary. In the incarnation, He revealed God to men, acted as their
              redeemer, and was established as the ruler over God’s kingdom.<br> He lived a sinless life, was crucified,
              dead, and buried, and on the third day he was raised to life, He ascended into heaven, and will come again
              in glory and judgment.<br> We teach that at the cross where He shed His blood and offered Himself
              sacrificially, He accomplished our redemption by acting as our mediator between man and God.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center"> The Holy Spirit</h2>
            <p>We believe and teach that the Holy Spirit is one in substance with the Father and the Son equal in all
              perfect attributes expressed both in personality and deity. We recognize His sovereign work in creation,
              the incarnation, the divine inspiration and revelation of scripture, and the work of salvation.<br> We
              teach His indwelling in the hearts of men that causes regeneration securing our salvation in Jesus Christ.
              <br>Further, that He performs sanctification, instruction, and empowerment of the believer in the
              workmanship of God’s vineyard. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center"> Creation</h2>
            <p>We believe and teach that the Holy Spirit is one in substance with the Father and the Son equal in all
              perfect attributes expressed both in personality and deity. We recognize His sovereign work in creation,
              <br> the incarnation, the divine inspiration and revelation of scripture, and the work of salvation. We
              teach His indwelling in the hearts of men that causes regeneration securing our salvation in Jesus Christ.
              <br> Further, that He performs sanctification, instruction, and empowerment of the believer in the
              workmanship of God’s vineyard.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center"> Man</h2>
            <p> We teach and believe that after God created the heavens and the earth, and the other creatures, He
              proceeded to create man, both male, and female, in His image and likeness. When God created man, he was
              created sinless and His moral responsibility was to God.<br> God’s intention was that man should glorify
              God and enjoy His fellowship but Adam who was the first man sinned and woefully fell in his
              responsibility. Because of this, all men became corrupted by Adam’s sin for all men were in Adam except
              Jesus Christ. <br> Man in his fall lost his innocence and incurred the penalty of both physical and
              spiritual death and by that became deserving of God’s wrath. The man was corrupted, and he morally
              <br>became incapable of choosing what was acceptable to God, and apart from God’s divine grace, the man
              forever is estranged to Him. Man has no power whatsoever to recover himself and is hopelessly lost. <br>
              Therefore, we affirm that salvation is entirely God’s work as an act of His grace through the redemptive
              work of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
