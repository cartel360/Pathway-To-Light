                        <p>This Privacy Policy tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your Personal
                            Information, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

                        <h2>HOW Mtu wa Kirk COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                        <p>For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating
                            to an identified or identifiable individual. We obtain Personal Information relating to you
                            from various sources as described below.</p>

                        <p>Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal
                            Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal
                            Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Service if that
                            information is necessary to provide you with the Service or if we are legally required to
                            collect it.</p>

                        <h4 id="heading">1>>Personal Information Provided by You</h4>

                        <p>Account Registration and Profile Creation. If you register to use the Service, then you must
                            provide us with your name, date of birth, a password and email address in order to create an
                            account and user profile. </p>

                        <p>Subscriptions. If you obtain a Subscription to the Service, then we will ask you to provide
                            your payment information, such as your credit card number, so our service providers can
                            process your payments for the Service.</p>

                        <p>Subscriptions. If you obtain a Subscription to the Service, then we will ask you to provide
                            your payment information, such as your credit card number, so our service providers can
                            process your payments for the Service.</p>

                        <h4 id="heading">2>>Personal Information Obtained from Third Parties</h4>

                        <p>Social Sign-on. We collect information from social media services when you use your
                            credentials for these services to log into the Service. For example, when you log in
                            with your Facebook credentials, we collect the information you have authorized
                            Facebook to share with us, such as your name, email address, gender, date of birth,
                            and profile picture. We may also obtain other non-public information with your
                            permission.</p>

                        <p>Other Third Parties. We may collect information about you from other third parties,
                            such as other users or our marketing partners. For example, we may receive
                            information about you when another user allows us to upload your contact information
                            to the Service. We may combine this information with the other information we
                            collect about you.</p>

                        <h4 id="heading">3>>Personal Information Collected From your Device via Automated Means
                        </h4>

                        <p>Using the Service. When you use the Service, we collect information about your
                            activities, such as the stations, artists or channels that you listen to, the User
                            profiles that you view, your searches for friends or stations and your other actions
                            and interactions with other Users or content on the Service, the stations, content
                            and people that you follow (“Follow Lists”), your comments, any content that you
                            post on the Service, and any other information resulting from your use of the
                            Service that is publicly accessible by other Users (“Public Information”).</p>

                        <p>Your Contacts. If you give us permission to import to the Service the contacts from
                            any email account associated with your account, then we may collect information
                            about your contacts. We may also collect your contacts if you share information or
                            content with them from the Service or invite them to use the Service.</p>

                        <p>Location Information. With your consent, we may obtain information about your
                            physical location at regular intervals when you use the Service, such as by use of
                            geolocation features in the device(s) through which you access the Service. In
                            addition, we may infer your location from other information we collect (for example,
                            your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are
                            connecting to the Internet). We use location information to comply with radio
                            stations’ content licenses (which are location-specific), and to provide you with
                            features, notifications, advertising, or other content that is influenced by your
                            location (such as showing you your local radio station).</p>

                        <p>Device Information. We receive information from Users’ devices through which a User
                            accesses the Service, such as IP address, web browser type, mobile operating system
                            version, and unique device identifiers.</p>

                        <p>Widget Information. Other websites may integrate TuneIn widgets (such as the TuneIn
                            Player or TuneIn Follow Button). When you visit a site with a TuneIn widget
                            embedded, we may receive certain information, including information about the web
                            page you visited, your IP address, and other information about your device. TuneIn
                            and the widget can recognize you across websites containing TuneIn widgets, and the
                            widget may be used to show personalized content or advertising. We know when you
                            interact with a widget, and websites containing the widgets may receive this
                            information.</p>

                        <h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                        <p>Internal and Service-Related Usage. We use Personal Information for internal and
                            Service-related purposes, including to operate, provide, and maintain the Service.
                        </p>

                        <p>Analytics and Improving the Service. We and our service providers use Personal
                            information that we collect on the Service, such as your location and your
                            activities on the Service, to monitor and analyze usage of the Service and to
                            improve and enhance the Service.</p>

                        <p>Communications. We may send emails to an email address you provide to us (i) for
                            customer-service or technical-support purposes, or (ii) to send you (a) information
                            about topics or content that we think may interest you, or (b) updates about the
                            latest developments or features on the Service. We also may send push notifications
                            to your device and a newsletter to the email address you provide to us in the event
                            that you subscribe to receive the newsletter.</p>

                        <p>Advertising. We and our advertising partners may use your Personal Information,
                            including your location and your activities on the Service to facilitate the

                            personalized services, content, offers and recommendations. For example, we may
                            analyze your listening history to recommend similar content that we think would be
                            of particular interest to you, send you tailored recommendations based on your
                            location or send you personalized marketing communications based on Personal
                            Information we have collected about you.</p>

                        <h2>HOW WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                        <p>Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any Personal Information we receive with
                            vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of the
                            Service. For example, we may use service providers to measure app usage and user
                            engagement, serve advertising on our Services or provide DDoS mitigation services.
                        </p>

                        <p>Publishers. We may share certain types of Personal Information with Publishers who
                            provide the content you listen to and read on our Service. This may include
                            information such as your device or cookie identifiers, device type, user agent, IP
                            address, and zip code.</p>

                        <p>Social Networking and Other Websites. The Service may allow you to share Personal
                            Information with social networking services, such as Facebook. We do not share your
                            Personal Information with them unless you direct the Service to share it. Their use
                            of your Personal Information is governed by their privacy policies, and you may be
                            able to modify your privacy settings on their services.</p>

                        <p>Search Engines. Your Public Information may also be accessible through search
                            engines, such as Google or Yahoo, just like with many common social media services.
                        </p>

                        <p>Other Third Parties. We may also share Personal Information about you with other
                            third parties in the following circumstances:</p>

                        <p> a)With Your Consent. We may disclose your Personal Information with your permission.
                            We may seek your permission in various ways. For example, we may present you with an
                            “opt-in” prompt when you register to use the Service or access certain content</p>

                        <p>b)To Comply with Legal Obligations. We may access, preserve, and disclose your
                            Personal Information or other account information if we believe doing so is required
                            or appropriate to (i) comply with laws, law enforcement requests, and legal process,
                            such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; or (iii) protect
                            your, our or others’ rights, property, or safety.</p>

                        <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                        <p>We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards that are intended to
                            appropriately protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful
                            destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or
                            access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal
                            Information in our possession. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to
                            be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal
                            Information you provide to us.</p>

                        <h2>DATA RETENTION</h2>

                        <p>We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does
                            not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the
                            purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this
                            information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into
                            account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or
                            provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible
                            re-enrollment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide
                            to you if we delete some information from or about you and mandatory retention
                            periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p>

                        <h2>THIRD PARTY PRIVACY PRACTICES</h2>

                        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the processing of your Personal Information by
                            TuneIn. The Service may contain links to third party sites, such as third party
                            content providers (“Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures described in
                            this Privacy Policy do not apply to Third Party Sites. The links from the Service to
                            any Third Party Sites do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party
                            Sites.</p>

                        <h2>PRIVACY OPTIONS AND SETTINGS</h2>

                        <p>Account Information. Once you have registered for the Service, you may change your
                            profile settings in your account on the Service. For example, you can change the
                            email address and password associated with your account and you may choose to keep
                            your Follow Lists private. If you are a broadcaster, you can change the information
                            you provided to us by contacting us per the information below.</p>

                        <p>Devices. You can access the Service from multiple devices if you sign into your
                            account on the devices or register them on the Service. If you would like to
                            disconnect your account from any of these devices, you can unregister the device
                            through your account settings on the Service.</p>

                        <p>Location Information. You can prevent us from collecting location information from
